I am a Computer Science graduate from the University of Leicester. I am currently working as a consultant, mostly in the field of software engineering and business analytics. This blog is based around a lot of my learning experiences from university as well as my involvement with many other tech related things. You may find tutorials, articles, rants and some experiments I have conducted. Feel free to disqus on my posts.
