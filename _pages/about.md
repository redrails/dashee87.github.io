I am studying Computer Science at the University of Leicester. Currently I am in my final year and hope to graduate in the class of 2018. This blog is based around a lot of my learning experiences from university as well as my involvement with many other tech related things. You may find tutorials, articles, rants and some experiments I have conducted. Feel free to disqus on my posts.
